# Assignment 3: For a given set of students distribute/divide them into 3 groups such that diversity of students in each group gets minimal.

## Implementation:

**I implemanted this problem using  A genetic algorithm-based clustering technique,in which clusters with similarities are made, also I've added 15 loops to make it efficient for complex inputs.**

### Compilation Instruction : g++ student.cpp
